# AutoIt scripts to setup the desktop environment after Login

# Moving apps to virtual desktops

Moving apps to a specific virtual desktop is not included in the 
scriptin language nor the bundled libraries. But others have implemented
some lines to overcome this flaw. Sadly, I could not identify a ready
to use script library. Therefor I refactored the code as good as I 
could, so that it comes as a library, that can be easily included in
your own user script.

See (the discussion in the support forum|https://www.autoitscript.com/forum/topic/206559-virtual-desktop-manager-under-windows-10/)
where I copied the code.
